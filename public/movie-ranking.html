<h1>The Best Movies According to Jesse</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Hercules</h3>
<p>This animated film, not to depressing, helped shape me as a man. My father being often absent, I would imagine he was off saving the world or some other heroic act. This movie instilled much of what I imagined being a "good man" was all about.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>I had to keep this up. I think this movie has evolved in meaning to me. As I've aged and lost loved ones, I've often reflected back on it. It has beauty, adventure, grief, loss, and all the other twists and turns life often throws our way.</p>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>Need I explain myself? ;P In all reality, I think we all hope to be as compassionate and forgiving as Forest, as sweet as Bubba, and as brave as Lieutenant Dan. A true masterpiece of creation.</p>
