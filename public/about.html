<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Jesse Cooper. I grew up in Ketchikan, Alaska. What they used to call a drinking town with a fishing problem. As we had the most bars per capita in the world. While that used to be funny, it didn't exactly age well. </p>

<p>I was raised primarily by my Mother and spent most of my holidays at my Grandmother's house. I grew up playing many sports: Baseball, Basketball, Football, Skateboarding, and running Cross-Country. As a kid, until I broke my femur playing football, I always dreamt that I would go to college and eventually be in the NFL! Aiming for the stars right? haha. Now most of my free time is spent playing with legos, playing video games, watching documentaries, sci-fi or true-crime, throwing heavy weights around, or playing guitar. </p>

<p>Later in life, after many roadtrips and a lot of inner-growth. I met my better half, Megan. Soon followed the greatest joy of my life, my son Ashton. These two continue to ground me, humor me, and challenge me. Simply the best. I'm currently a CS major at Western Governor's University. Hoping to land a Software Engineering job and in some way hope to help better the world. If you have any ideas, I'm all ears!</p>
